However, you don't look forward to eating it raw, and decide that it may be
a good idea to find somewhere to cook the turnip first.

The small new leaves of this plant have a sweet lemony taste while the
larger older leaves tend to taste extremely bitter.  This edible plant is a
staple food in many areas, but it's fairly rare around Rune.  You remember
an old woman talking about the edible plant not growing near the ocean,
because the salt from the water covers the leaves and steals the water out
of the plant, killing it over time.

Once a fine specimen of bovine, this young cow did not make it past its

for its blood.  Now all that awaits this former calf is to become a meal for
a giant.  Given the size of the animal and the size of the giants, it's
entirely possible that a single giant might finish this beast off or perhaps
make a romantic evening out of it with an associate.

A little known fact is that the stomach bile of dragons, even after death,
is intensely poisonous.  Indeed, some dragons even draw some of their
poisonous breath from their bile.  Igglwilvy, the pet dragon of the orc
chieftain Graalg, has apparently come to an unpleasant end, because his
particular stomach is here.  It is a dark brown, and makes squishy sounds as
the bile within mixes.  Eventually, the toxins may naturally expire, but
until then this is a dangerous artifact.

This little flake of clotted blood lies on the ground.  Apparently its
owner no longer need this to stop the bleeding of whatever wound they once
had.  Fortunately the person who this nasty shard of skin once belonged to
decided to drop it rather that eat it.  It probably deserves to be buried
but some horrible urge deep within makes you want to pick it up.

Plucked from the socket of a xorn-hydra crossbreed, this gross little
treat is really something.  Although it smells terrible, its innate magical
powers would likely be a boon to any adventurer.  The eyeball itself looks
fused, as though the perceptory orb of a hydra were grafted onto one of a
xorn, and the result were stuffed into the skull of the similarly resultant
beast.  It is squished, abused, and disgusting, but ultimately could be
quite useful..  
+++ a dilated, purple eyeball will, when worn, cast 'infravision' on its
wearer, with a maximum frequency of once per 40 minute period.

This is the disgusting snout of an aurumvorax.  The beast's snout is just
as horrible as its body, and you feel your stomach lurch as your hand
touches some gooey slime still oozing out of the nostrils of the hideous
thing.  It is pale in color from all the blood draining out of it when it
was severed from the body and if you are hungry, you could probably try and
eat it.  What's the worst that could happen?

Being eaten and exposed to the sun has left these various body parts smelly
and unidentifiable.  They are bloody, have frequent bite marks, and there is
as much rotted green as blood red.  A few tears mark where claws shredded
the meat for consumption.  A few bubbles of pus complete the disgust.
