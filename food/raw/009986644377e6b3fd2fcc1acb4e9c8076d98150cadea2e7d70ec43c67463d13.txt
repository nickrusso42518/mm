The salad of Teolaven is a favorite among the locals and visitors.  The
salad has crisp Teolaven leaves tossed with a homemade dressing, croutons,
anchovies, and dusted with parmesan.  Although some people like it, they are
typically sharp-billed harpies, such as the peckerwoods that inhabit the
south of Beltane.  It is odd that the restaurant would cater to such
subhumanoids, but nevertheless, they do.
