A large bunch of seaweed is floating here.  It is long and dark green in
color.  It stinks as some of it is beginning to decay.  You can see little
fish darting in and out of it hoping to grab a quick meal from the algae and
shrimp that cling to it.  You decide against getting too close, as you fear
getting entangled within.
