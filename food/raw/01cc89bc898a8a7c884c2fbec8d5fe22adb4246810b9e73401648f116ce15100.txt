This used to be the corpse of a male knight who recently died under
mysterious circumstances.  A large portion of his torso has been eaten away,
leaving a strange black acrid slime behind.  The smell of rotting flesh
mixed with the black slime is overpowering to even the hardiest of
minotaurs.  The eyes of the corpse have strangely been enveloped by a layer
of slime, giving the corpse an almost demonic feel.
