A little known fact is that the stomach bile of dragons, even after death,
is intensely poisonous.  Indeed, some dragons even draw some of their
poisonous breath from their bile.  Igglwilvy, the pet dragon of the orc
chieftain Graalg, has apparently come to an unpleasant end, because his
particular stomach is here.  It is a dark brown, and makes squishy sounds as
the bile within mixes.  Eventually, the toxins may naturally expire, but
until then this is a dangerous artifact.
