Inside this glazed red ceramic bowl, an island of flaky corn ascends from
an ocean of fresh milk.  The milk froths around the sides of the bowl, as
flakes on the shores of the island disintegrate.  Each flake of corn has
been individually pressed in a complicated process, but on a morning like
this one, better things are to be thought of than food manufacturing
processes.
