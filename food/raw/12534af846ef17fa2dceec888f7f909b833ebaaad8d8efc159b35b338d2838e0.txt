This is the disgusting snout of an aurumvorax.  The beast's snout is just
as horrible as its body, and you feel your stomach lurch as your hand
touches some gooey slime still oozing out of the nostrils of the hideous
thing.  It is pale in color from all the blood draining out of it when it
was severed from the body and if you are hungry, you could probably try and
eat it.  What's the worst that could happen?
