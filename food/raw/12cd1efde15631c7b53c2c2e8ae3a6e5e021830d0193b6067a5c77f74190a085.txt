It is a still warm loaf of freshly baked French bread that is as long as
your arm and about as big around.  Its warmth feels good in your hands and
its aroma makes your mouth water in anticipation.  While the crust has been
baked hard, you should be able to cut through it easily enough, or, if you
have to, break a piece off.
