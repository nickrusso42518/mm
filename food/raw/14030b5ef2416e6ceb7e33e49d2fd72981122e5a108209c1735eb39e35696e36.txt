Plucked from the socket of a xorn-hydra crossbreed, this gross little
treat is really something.  Although it smells terrible, its innate magical
powers would likely be a boon to any adventurer.  The eyeball itself looks
fused, as though the perceptory orb of a hydra were grafted onto one of a
xorn, and the result were stuffed into the skull of the similarly resultant
beast.  It is squished, abused, and disgusting, but ultimately could be
quite useful..  
+++ a dilated, purple eyeball will, when worn, cast 'infravision' on its
wearer, with a maximum frequency of once per 40 minute period.
