Always willing to try new things, you thought it might be a good idea to
sample the fried rat.  Now that it's sitting here, you begin to have second
thoughts.  While it looks like most of the animal's hair has been removed,
the legs and head are still attached to the body.  At least, that's what you
think they are.  With a meal this crispy, it's hard to tell.
