Silverthorn is a rare plant, as it can only grow in places where there has
been significant death or decay.  The leaves look edible, although you would
have to avoid the thorns, since they are coated in a deadly venom.  If
processed properly, the silverthorn plant can be used in many potions and
medicines.
