This New Kolvir fish corpse looks relatively fresh, despite the foul
scent it exudes and the gaps between the scales that look like they are
beginning to decay.  Each of the many scales that cover the fish's body
shimmer with a silver luminescence.  Obviously this type of carp is a
primary food source for New Kolvir.
