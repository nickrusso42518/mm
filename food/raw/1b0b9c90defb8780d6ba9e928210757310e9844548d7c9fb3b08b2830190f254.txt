At first glance, it appears to be a small, dark-brown, shiny rock, but it 
is far too light for that.  Looking closer, you see that it is covered 
with a dark-brown chocolate shell, and that it only partially covers what 
seems to be a truffle.  Sticking out of the bottom of the chocolate shell 
is the stem of a luscious mushroom.
