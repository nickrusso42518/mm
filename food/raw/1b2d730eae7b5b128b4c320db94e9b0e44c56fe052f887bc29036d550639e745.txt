This red apple was grown on a tree in an orchard not too far away from
here.  It looks very delicious and will probably taste very good, should you
choose to eat it.  Still, before you gobble it down, it might be wise to
inspect it more carefully since you really don't know where this apple has
been before it got to your hands.
