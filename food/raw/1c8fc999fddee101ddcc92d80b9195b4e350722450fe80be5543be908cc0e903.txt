Freshly broken from a head of lettuce, this bright green leaf is still
fresh and crispy.  The leaf is quite large in size; in fact it's almost as
big as a ogre's hand.  Several drops of dew have condensed along the sides
of the leaf and slowly roll towards the bottom of it.  Tiny green veins
weave their way throughout the leaf creating intricate patterns.  This bait
would be best suited for a tiny copper trap.
