This luscious avocado roll looks like it would be a tasty treat indeed!  
Nestled into the bed of rice are several slices of succulent avocado, 
along with several tasty morsels of pickled ginger.  Just add a dab of 
wasabi to spice it up, or drizzle a little soy sauce over it for a change 
of pace.
