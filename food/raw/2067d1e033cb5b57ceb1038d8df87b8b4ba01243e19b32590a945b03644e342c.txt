Here is a steamy, orangeish red lobster.  It appears to be well cooked
and in good condition, and seems to be appropriate for a nice evening meal.

into a simmering pot to be cooked...  But you forget the image anyway,
tuning in to your hunger and attempt to stop your drooling before you buy
the meal.
