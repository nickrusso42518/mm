Quickly grown with the help of a magical force, this carrot, still
covered in a thin layer of moist dirt, has recently been dug out of the
ground.  Several long green leaves protrude from the top of it and cascade
down the sides.  Its shape is strange, large at one end and thin at the
other.  Its total length is no more than ten inches but it could still
provide quite a hearty meal.
