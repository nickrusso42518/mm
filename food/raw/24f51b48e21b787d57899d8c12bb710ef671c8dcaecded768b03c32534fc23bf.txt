*A clump of silver clover will last approximately 24,000 more Alyrian minutes.
A little pile of shining silver, three-leaved clovers has been pressed
tightly together, creating a ball.  Several small stems stick out from its
sides, making it look untidy.  The ball of clover breaths as the pressure
being applied to it is released.  A strong, pleasant aroma rises from it and
fills the area.
