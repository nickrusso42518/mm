Oh!  How repulsing, you hold in your hands a freshly decapitated chicken
carcass, it is completely splattered in its own blood.  Quite a few of its
feathers lies scattered about on the floor, suggesting that as a part of the
ritual for which it was slaughtered, they were torn off and thrown about. 
It appears that another part of the ritual was to rip out the chicken's
entrails, but you can't find any remnants of entrails so maybe they were
devoured.
