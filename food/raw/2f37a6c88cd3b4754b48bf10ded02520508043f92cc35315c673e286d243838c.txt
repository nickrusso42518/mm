A peanut butter cookie sits on the counter in a jar.  This large, golden
brown cookie is moist to the touch and tempting to the taste buds.  The
fresh smell of peanuts is almost too much to resist.  Tasting it, you can
really taste the peanuts and it has just a hint of sugar.  You suddenly wish
that you had a glass of milk to go along with this wonderful cookie.
