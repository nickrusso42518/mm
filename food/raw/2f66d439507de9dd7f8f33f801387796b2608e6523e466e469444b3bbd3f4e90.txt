This small radially ribbed shell looks like what most adventurers think
of when they hear a clam shell.  Its tan surface is striped with white
marks.  Its mouth is bumpy with lichen.  Lowangen and Lake Martoon are
famous for cockles of this variety, many of which bear pearls inside.  In
old Alyrian tales about Lady Saresyn, she is said to have eaten cockles
every meal.  Because of these stories they have become a traditional
delicacy in Rune, and surrounding Sepharian cities where cockles are rare.
