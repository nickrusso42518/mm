Rich white chocolate icing is smothered across this layered cake.  Each
layer is a slightly different color and has a strange texture to it unlike
most cakes.  The cake itself is quite large and could easily fill most
stomachs, but it is too rich for most to eat in one sitting.  The smells of
brown sugar and something like vanilla drift from the cake enticing you to
take a bite.
