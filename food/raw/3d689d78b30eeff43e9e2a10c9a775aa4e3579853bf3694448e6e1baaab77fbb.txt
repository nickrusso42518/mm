This gigantic chocolate chip cookie has enormous chunks of chocolate
scattered through it.  The cookie has been freshly baked, and therefore it
is moist, chewy, and warm.  The smell is unmistakable and reminds you of
your mothers home cooking.  The only thing that could possibly make this
treat better is a tall, cold glass of fresh milk.
