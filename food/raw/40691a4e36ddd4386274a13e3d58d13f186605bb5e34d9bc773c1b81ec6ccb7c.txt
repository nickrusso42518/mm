A bunch of red grapes glistens with here in the sunlight.  They are deep
red in color and are still attached to a deep green stem.  You remember
having seen these kinds of grapes before, then remember that you saw these
once in a winery.  These grapes are used to create some of the best wine
available in Rune.
