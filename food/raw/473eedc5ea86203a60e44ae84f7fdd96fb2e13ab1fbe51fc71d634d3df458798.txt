Maggots swarm all over this disgusting piece of meat, flesh ripped from
some hapless traveler.  Discolored, the stench of the meat wrinkles your
nose and causes your stomach to quiver restlessly.  Are you hungry enough to

you cook it over a nice fire you'll be able to forget all the maggots
crawling all over it.
