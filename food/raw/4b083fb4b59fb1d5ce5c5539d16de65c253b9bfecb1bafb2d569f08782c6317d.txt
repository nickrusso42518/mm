Bantam eggs are generally smaller and slightly speckled unlike the larger
of their species.  This speckled-brown egg is still slightly warm to the
touch and has a small amount of feces still clinging to the calcium rich
shell.  As the shell has a slight yellow color to it, it is doubtful that
this egg will actually hatch into anything alive, it may be good for a feed
though.
