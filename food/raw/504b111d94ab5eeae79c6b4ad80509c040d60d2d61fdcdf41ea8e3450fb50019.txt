A generous portion of mashed potatos and thick slices of roast beef
covered in smooth gravy starts your stomach growling and mouth drooling as
you catch sight and scent of it.  The meat looks to be tender and juicy,
slow cooked in spices and vegetables.  The potatos are thick and creamy,
heavily covered in butter.  The gravy is a deep, rich brown colour, with
lots of pepper in it for spicing.  This is a meal fit for any walk of life.
