The swamp weed only grows in the muddy dank waters of the swamps.  Like
the swamps itself, the weed smells awful, although it appears to be edible,
its odor is sickening.  But you are really hungry, and decide that you are
hungry enough to ignore the stench from it.  You can only hope that it
tastes better than it smells, and that your willpower can win over the
disgusting odor and keep you from vomiting.
