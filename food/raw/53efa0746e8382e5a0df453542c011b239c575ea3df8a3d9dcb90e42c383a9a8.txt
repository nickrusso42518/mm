This delicious strawberry pie is warm and freshly baked.  You wish you
had a glass of milk to drink with it.  Made from the freshly picked fruit
just beyond the gate, the pie looks mouth watering and almost too good to be
true.  You cut a large piece for yourself, sampling a small taste of the
pie's filling first.
