Blowfish is a delicacy, harvested from the toxic creatures in the Proving
Grounds.  As such, it is very, very rare, and in such limited quantities as
to be almost impossible to obtain.  However, the culinary staff at Eanoss
Azelmar specialize in exactly such comissions, and this pink piece of meat
lays on a small china plate, waiting to be tasted.  However, it should not
be eaten outside of the presence of a shaman, due to the high rate of
accidental poisioning upon consumption..
