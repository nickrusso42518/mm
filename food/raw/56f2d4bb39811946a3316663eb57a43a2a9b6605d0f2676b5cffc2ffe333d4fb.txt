Specially grown seaweed boiled for several minutes creates this wonderful
dish.  The soup warms the body all the way down, fighting off the chill that
comes from staying underwater so long.  The flavour is a bit spicy, but
still wonderful for an all natural soup.  How they keep it warm in all this
water is beyond you, perhaps there is a bit of magic in it after all.
