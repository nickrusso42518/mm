This is Kraz's specialty - boiled rat.  With little else to work with, he
does what he can with whatever he can find, rats being the easiest thing for
him to catch.  Often the rat is thrown whole into the pot, where it boils
until it falls apart, adding 'flavor' to the stew - which leads one what
part of the rat this piece is.
