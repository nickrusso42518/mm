Numerous kinds of lettuce and greenery make this salad, humorously named
after a politician hailing from the Palace of Diocletian.  Its dressing in
particular distinguishes itself from other greenery, a slightly salty
concoction that makes the lettuce and other vegetables particularly tangy. 
Originally created by one of the commoners of the far-off palace, it was
named to honor of its original benefactors, and has been known thusly ever
since.
