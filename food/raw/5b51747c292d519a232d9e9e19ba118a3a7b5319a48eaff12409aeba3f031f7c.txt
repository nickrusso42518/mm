Always willing to try new things, you thought it might be a good idea to
sample the fried seagull.  Now that it's sitting here, you begin to have
second thoughts.  While it looks like most of the bird's feathers have been
removed, the legs and head are still attached to the body.  At least, that's
what you think they are.  With a meal this crispy, it's hard to tell.
