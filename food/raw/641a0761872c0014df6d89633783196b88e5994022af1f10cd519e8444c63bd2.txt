This strange vegetable does not look all that appetizing.  It is a sickly
white in color, and its pulpy flesh is gnarled and bumpy.  Still, you decide
that it is no different from a potato, and would probably be tasty if
prepared properly.  You could probably eat it raw, but you don't look
forward to trying.
