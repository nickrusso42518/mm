This food has the traits tuber.
This tuber was probably a foot long when it was pulled from the ground. 
Now it is about eight inches long and four inches across.  The end of this
tuber is missing, probably the result of a close encounter with one of the
creatures that dwell in this area.  The tuber is brown skinned but the meat
looks to be an orange color.  A little bit of dirt clings to the sides of
the sweet potato.  If you cut off the partially-eaten end, you could
probably make a fine meal out of this potato.
