This plate of ravioli is essentially a bunch of hollow noodles that are
full of spinach.  Ravoili can come with many types of stuffings, but spinach
seems to be the specialty of this dish.  The ravioli is covered with a pasty
tomato sauce.  The entire dish gives off an odor that you find quite
different than in most foods, nonetheless it does look delicious.
