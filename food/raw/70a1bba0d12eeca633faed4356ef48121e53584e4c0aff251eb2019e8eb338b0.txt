This is a rather strange item but nonetheless looks rather delicious.  It
is a string of cubed meats, potatoes, and other vegetables on a small wooden
skewer that drives itself right through the center of these foods.  The
meats and vegetables are small enough so that they sit on there without
falling off.  All of the items on the shish kebab are well cooked and ready
to be eaten.
