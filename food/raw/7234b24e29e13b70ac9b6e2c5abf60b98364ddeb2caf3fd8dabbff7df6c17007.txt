This is a small cracker.  It is white in color, almost like a saltine, and
bends slightly when you try to break it in half.  To be this stale, it must
have been here quite a long while.  It has a small bit of salt sprinkled on
top of it for flavor, and is square.  If you're really hungry, it is
probably edible.
