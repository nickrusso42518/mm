Layers of large lettuce leaves wrap around each other to create this
crisp head.  Freshly cut from the roots, it still has small patches of dirt
on the leaves.  The foliage, still growing, is snow-white at the bottom and
gradually turns green towards the top.  Large drops of dew have begun to
form at the edge of the leaves and collect in a small pool of water at the
center of the head.  This bait would be best suited for a large admantite
trap.
