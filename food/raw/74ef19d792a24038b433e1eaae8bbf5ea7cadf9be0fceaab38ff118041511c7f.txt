This large, ripe orange looks as though it has only recently fallen from an
orange tree.  You should probably hang on to it if you plan on making any
long sea voyages in the near future, since it can prevent you from getting
scurvy.  However you think to yourself that only pirates get scurvy, and eat
the orange anyway.
