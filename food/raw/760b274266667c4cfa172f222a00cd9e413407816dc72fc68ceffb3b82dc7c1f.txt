This ear of corn looks normal at first, since it has a green sheath
surrounding it.  However, as you look inside you are amazed to find that its
kernels are purple instead of yellow.  You pull one off, and cannot find
anything wrong except its unusual color.  You wonder what kind of soil is
needed to produce such a strange plant.
