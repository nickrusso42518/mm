This food has the traits raw-plant.
This is one of the strangest plants you've ever seen, given the fact it
doesn't look like any kind of plant at all.  It grows in a circular
snowflake pattern, yet it isn't green at all, but it is a mix of many
colors.  It has no visible roots or stems, and doesn't breathe.  A small
patch of moisture is visible on it, possibly from dew, mil or otherwise, but
more likely reindeer's saliva.  It is, after all, one of their favorite
foods.
