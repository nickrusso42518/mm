This large, ripe orange looks as though it has only recently fallen from
an orange tree.  You should probably hang on to it if you plan on making any
long sea voyages in the near future, since it can help prevent you from
getting scurvy.  However you think to yourself "only pirates get scurvy" and
eat the orange now anyway.
