Once a fine specimen of bovine, this young cow did not make it past its
days as a calf.  Someone, likely a giant, has slit its throat and bled it
for its blood.  Now all that awaits this former calf is to become a meal for
a giant.  Given the size of the animal and the size of the giants, it's
entirely possible that a single giant might finish this beast off or perhaps
make a romantic evening out of it with an associate.
