Without a face, this pile of leaves has a taste only a mother reindeer
could love.  Dead and dried, they're brittle, and snap without much
provocation.  Grey in color and blue in personality, they have fallen from a
weeping willow during the annual autumnal purge.  They have been swept into
a pile for disposal, likely by burning, but with this sudden influx of
reindeer, this favorite food of theirs could come in handy.
