These two small eyeballs come from some creature with advanced sight. 
They look sort of human, but a deep crimson cloud fills their background, as
though it were some sick, insane beast.  Optic nerves, which have been
knotted together hang off the back of each eye.  The membranes on the eyes
are dried out, and crunchy.  These fun foods are great for fey children!
