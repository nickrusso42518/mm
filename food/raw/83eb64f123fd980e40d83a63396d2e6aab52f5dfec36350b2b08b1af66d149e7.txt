Appearing to have been enchanted by some strange magic to cause such a
brilliant, vibrant color, this small egg shines radiantly against the light
here.  The same magic, however, that has made it so beautiful also seems to
have made it extremely fragile, as even the simple breeze that flows through
this room has began to peel at its outer shell.  Curious...  Wasn't someone
asking for these fragile eggs?
