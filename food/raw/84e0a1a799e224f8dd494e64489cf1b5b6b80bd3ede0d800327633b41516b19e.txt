This heart has been torn from the chest of an angry minotaur and is covered
with his blood.  Some cultures believe that to eat an enemy's heart is to
claim their power for oneself.  Are you feeling hungry?  You look at the
bloody heart, and hope that it tastes slightly better than it smells.  It is
still warm to the touch, so you hope whatever killed this beast isn't
lurking around here still.
