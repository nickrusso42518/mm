If the bright orange tint to the mushroom isn't warning enough, the bizarre,
twisting spots covering the hood might help, as well as the teeth embedded
in the top.  Poisonous enough that the victim's teeth drop out instantly,
these mushrooms are well-known to denizens of the forest, and less so to the
temporal adventurers who wander in, but not back out.  Handling them is
perfectly safe, but as for eating them...there are quicker, more pleasant
deaths available.  Don't do it.
