Unlike most cakes, these are not made from flour.  Rather, the bones of
deceased animals...  Well, hopefully animals...  Have been ground into a
fine bone powder and mixed with blood and other ingredients before being
left to congeal.  The resulting cakes are mostly white, owing to the bones,
and very high in calcium.  A favorite of many young giants.
