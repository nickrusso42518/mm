These lemonade berries, while small and seemingly insignificant, are a
great source of energy.  Although they taste a bit green, they're sweet and
tangy, and give you a certain renewed energy.  They're clumped into bunches
of about a dozen or so, and small enough that you could pop several of these
bunches into your mouth at once, for extra power.
