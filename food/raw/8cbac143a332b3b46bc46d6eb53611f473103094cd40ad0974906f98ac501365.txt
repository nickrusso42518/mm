This small, twisted carcass looks like the body of a mouse but is a lot
larger.  Its eyes are open, eternally fixed in the stare of the dead.  Its
long tail appears to be bent in the middle, as if something with weight has
been pressed against it for prolonged periods of time.  It is starting to
give off a foul stench.
