This dry root is from a jabbar plant.  You remember it as being both tasty
and nutritious, and not at all poisonous.  You suddenly realize how hungry
you are.  Your mouth starts to water.  As you bite into the tasty root and
start eating it, you imagine that you also have some of those yellow glowing
slugs that taste so well when eaten together with the jabbar root.
