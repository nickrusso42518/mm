A dark brown crust coats the entire surface of this loaf of bread.  It is
rather hard and hollow sounding when you knock upon it, but it is highly
filling nonetheless.  The bread makers in the world aren't praised enough
for their work in making these.  It takes a skilled hand to knead and know
when it is ready for baking.  You tear off a chunk of bread and chew on it,
noting its savoury flavours.
