Bagels are a yummy addition to the active warrior's diet.  They are
boiled and then baked to a crusty golden brown.  Because of their small
size, you can store lots of them in a small space, and they keep well during
long journeys.  This bagel is just waiting to be eaten, and would be best
with some butter or cream cheese.
