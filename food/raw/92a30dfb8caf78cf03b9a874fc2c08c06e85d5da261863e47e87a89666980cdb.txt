You hold in your hands a very large apple.  Rumours have it that the
wandering druids wander around orchards and enhance the quality of the
apples.  This looks to be something of their work, you suspect.  It does
look really sweet and delicious.  One apple won't spoil your dinner, unless
you happen to eat more than three or four.
