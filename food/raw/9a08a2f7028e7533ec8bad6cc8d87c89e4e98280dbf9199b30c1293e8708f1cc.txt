An undergrond breed of snail has been topped with dozens of multicolored
sprinkles.  The combination seems odd but for those with a sweet tooth it
could be very tasty.  The numerous candies coating the snail almost disguise
the fact that it is a snail.  It may be wise to get something to wash this
down with though in case it tastes worse than it appears.
