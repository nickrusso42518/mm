A yummy breadstick, covered with sesame seeds, is here.  This bread stick
has that smell that can only come from fresh baked bread.  The crust is a
light brown and just a little bit hard.  The inside is steamy warm and
moist.  The crust has been lightly coated with just a touch of olive oil. 
It tastes like pure heaven.
