This large wicker basket is filled with several slices of appetizing
bread.  A cloth napkin wrapped around the basket keeps its contents warm,
and as you unwrap it a delightful aroma wafts out.  You break off a piece of
bread and take a bite, only to discover that it is one of the most
foul-tasting things you've ever eaten.  Apparently the orcs aren't very good
cooks after all.
