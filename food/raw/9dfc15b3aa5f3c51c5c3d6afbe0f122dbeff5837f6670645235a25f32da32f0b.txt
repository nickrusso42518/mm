This piece of herring has been well preserved, considering the amount of
salt that is in it.  Herring is not very common to the northern part of the
world, so in order to keep it fresh, the salt must be added to prevent
bacteria from eating the fish.  Even with its salty taste, the herring can
provide a good meal, especially for those in a real hurry.
