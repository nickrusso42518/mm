Several varieties of meat have been combined to form this cold cut
salami.  From the smell of it you'd say that it's probably best not to ask
what exactly is combined.  After a hard day's work this could easily supply
one with a full belly either on a sandwich or just by itself.  The wrapping
around it would also suggest that it keeps very well.
