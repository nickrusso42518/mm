Clear, pure salt is the final product of Colyon's salt mining business. 
It is rough and rather, err, salty.  It sells almost as well as the fish
that it cures and dries, and better than the dried fruit, even if it isn't
as tasty by itself.  It can be used in food, and some people even use it as
a magical reagent.  Salt's a pretty useful thing, you know.
