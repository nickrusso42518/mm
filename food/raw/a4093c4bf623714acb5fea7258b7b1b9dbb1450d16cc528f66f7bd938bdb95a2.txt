Barley does not make for such a great bread, but it is cheap and readily
available.  The baker that made this loaf at least knew to include a few
handfuls of partially sprouted barley in with the dough to give it a bit of
tooth.  Cheap or not, this loaf looks filling and healthy.  All one has to
do is type 'EAT LOAF' or 'EAT BARLEY'.
