The high stench of dead fish invades the once fresh air around you.  This
little mound of meat looks as though it has been kicked and stepped on a few
times.  Maggots wiggle while feasting on the flesh around the egg sacks of
future maggots.  The sight turns your stomach while the smells lift your
stomach, and an acid smell burns in your nose as the contents of your
stomach hover posed to reject your last meal.
