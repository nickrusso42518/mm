A long baguette is here, fresh from the oven.  The smell of this fresh
bread is almost addictive.  This bread is thin and long and appears to have
been made from to pieces of dough twisted together.  The outside is light
brown in color, and the inside is soft and moist.  The baker that made this
is a true artist.
