These small purple berries both look and smell very strange, you are able
to identify them as lannyam berries, and a type you know not to be
poisonous.  You consider that very lucky because you are starving and these
berries, although they are not very appetizing or tasty, just have to do for
a meal.  Especially since you have not been able to find anything else to
eat, and because you dont know when you will be able to find any other food.
