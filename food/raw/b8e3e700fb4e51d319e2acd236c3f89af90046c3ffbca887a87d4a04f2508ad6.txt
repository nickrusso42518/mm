This food has the traits raw-meat prepared.
The marbled appearance of the salami is due to the meat mixture of what must
be venison and goat meat stuffed into an edible casing and hung to cure. 
During the curing process something extra was added to the casing to impart
more flavor to the meat.  Additional spices have been added to the meat
before it was sold which gives it a slightly sharp scent, but not in the
least unpleasant.
