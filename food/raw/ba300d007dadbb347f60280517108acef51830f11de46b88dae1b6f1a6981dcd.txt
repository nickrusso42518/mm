This potato has been well cooked and baked so that its insides are mushy
and soft.  Wrapped in some sort of light paper so that its heat doesn't burn
you, it is ready to be carried out the door so you won't have to spend a lot
of time getting a quick meal.  Be careful though, even with the paper, the
potato will become extremely hot if held in one hand for too long.
