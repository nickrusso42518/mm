This food has the traits raw-meat.
This piece of meat comes from a large wild rabbit.  Because they are so
numerous in the forests near New Rigel, many hunters focus on catching them.
Although the bunnies are rather small, they are quite dim-witted, and will
assume that you do not notice them unless you look directly at them.  Thus,
they are extremely easy to capture.
