If southern fried rat tastes as bad as it smells it's no surprise that
nobody ever orders one from the barkeep.  The only way this could happen
would be if someone were to eat one for a dare or if they were too drunk to
care.  They would probably regret it in the morning when the fur starts to
make it's way through the body.  Dare or not the thought of eating a rat
makes your stomach turn a little.
