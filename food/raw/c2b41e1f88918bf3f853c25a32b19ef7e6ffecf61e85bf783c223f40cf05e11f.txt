This small strip of meat has been ripped from the carcass of a freshly
slaughtered cow.  The blood still pools around the edges, making it
succulent and juicy looking.  It looks as though it would be almost the
perfect size for a bird to eat, not much more than a mouthful but enough to
sustain them for a while.
