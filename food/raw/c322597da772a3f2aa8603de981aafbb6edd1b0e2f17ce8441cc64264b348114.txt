This is a large leg, from what must have been one of the largest turkeys
to have ever existed on Alyria.  Its skin is crispy golden brown, and it is
tender and juicy underneath.  The smell of it is nearly intoxicating, and it
causes your mouth to salivate.  While it is more than you really wish to pay
you decided it is well worth the price.
