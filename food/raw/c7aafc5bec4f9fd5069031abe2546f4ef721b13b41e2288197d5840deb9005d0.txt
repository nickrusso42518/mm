This singular leaf has been carelessly ripped from a large bunch of
spinach; thin tears ascend from the bottom of the leaf, abruptly stopping
after a few inches.  The leaf itself is limp and dark green in color.  Small
crinkles cover each side of the large leaf showing its natural growth
pattern.  An intense aroma emanates from it and lingers on anything that
touches it.
