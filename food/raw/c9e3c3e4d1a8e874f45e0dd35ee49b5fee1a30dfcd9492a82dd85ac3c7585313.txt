This pale head was removed from a Sidhe Official.  You do not recognize
it, as it is caked with scabs and dirt.  A part of the spinal column
protrudes from the neck giving one a clean place to hold it.  The hair has
been entirely shaved off of it, and the brain sucked out through a small
hole in the skull.
