Layers of dough, kneaded and raised then baked to a golden brown, form
the soft and flakey layers of this delicious biscuit.  A delicate pat of
fresh creamy butter has been sandwiched in the middle between two halves of
the biscuit.  The warmth of the freshly baked dough causes the butter to
ooze out the sides.
