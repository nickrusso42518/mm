A large, beige root has been unearthed here.  It is still covered with
soil, but otherwise looks clean.  Unlike most of the other food that you
have seen down here, this looks edible, and is not rotting, or decaying in
any way.  It looks like it would be good roasted over your campfire.  Your
mouth begins to water as you think of having this for dinner tonight.
