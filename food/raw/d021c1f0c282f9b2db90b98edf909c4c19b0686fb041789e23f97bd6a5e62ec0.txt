Although created imperfectly, this small cookie resembles a man with his
arms and legs splayed out.  Three small candies have been placed on its head
to create a face and several dots of icing trail down its body for buttons. 
Still rather warm, it has just been removed from an oven and a strong aroma
of ginger nut rises from it.
