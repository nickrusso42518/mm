This overturned raw brown potato is partially covered in soil and looks
quite dirty.  While it does not look good in its current state, it will
definitely taste better when cooked.  Alternatively if you like it fresh,
you should just peel off the skin and remove the eyes so that it would look
a little more appetizing.
