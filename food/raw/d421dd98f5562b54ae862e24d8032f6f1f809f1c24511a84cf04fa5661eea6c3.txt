This pale strip of dried meat obviously came from one of the various
species of fish that patrols the Wampa in seach of food.  It has been dried
by means of salting, and has been flavored by the process.  It is rough to
the touch, and rather salty to taste, but it is very filling, and quite
healthy.  This strip of fish meat is probably only one of many, though,
since salted fish is the main export of Colyon.
