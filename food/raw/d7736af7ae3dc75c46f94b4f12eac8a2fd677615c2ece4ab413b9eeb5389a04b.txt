Peas are one of the basic crops of the Sepharian farmers.  Peas vines both
grow well in the rocky soil and can be planted in the same fields as corn. 
There they climb the corn stalks, making for double the harvest from
valuable farmland.  Additionally, peas can be dried and store well for
years, as these have been.  If one were hungry, one might pick these up and
type 'EAT PEAS' or 'EAT DRIED' to consume them.
