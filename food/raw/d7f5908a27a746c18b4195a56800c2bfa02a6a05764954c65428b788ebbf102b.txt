This fillet of piranha smells awesome.  It has been cooked Cajun style
with spices, seasoning and vegetables.  You look around for a source of
water before you start to eat knowing that it is going to be very hot.  It
is hard to believe that such a mean little fish could be so good is truly
surprising.
