Resting on the table here is a hunk of red ground beef, uncooked,
obviously waiting for someone to pick it up and use it in a nice meal.  The
texture of the meat looks very promising and the idea of it on the side of
your dinner plate makes your mouth water.  You start thinking of a meal with
mashed potatoes, green beans and a good red cabernet.
