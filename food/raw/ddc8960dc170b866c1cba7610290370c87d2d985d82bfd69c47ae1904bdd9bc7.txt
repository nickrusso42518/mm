This vegetable is a fresh carrot.  Its massive gradual conic body is two
feet long and the green leaves protruding from its top are many inches long.
It is a bright, almost unnatural, orange.  Though naturally dirty, the
carrot seems to have been cleaned off in preparation for consumption by the
horses.  Though they are safe for the horses to eat, maybe the carrots are
unsafe for human use.
