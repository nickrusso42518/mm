The small new leaves of this plant have a sweet lemony taste while the
larger older leaves tend to taste extremely bitter.  This edible plant is a
staple food in many areas, but it's fairly rare around Rune.  You remember
an old woman talking about the edible plant not growing near the ocean,
because the salt from the water covers the leaves and steals the water out
of the plant, killing it over time.
