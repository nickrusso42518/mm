These grapes are in pretty bad shape.  Their juices have been extracted
by the vintner to create the next perfect wine.  The sweetness that is
Alyria's natural candy has been sucked from them by the hammering of bare
feet, leaving a cold, bitter skin behind.  While their sacrifice is
appreciated by those who enjoy the wine, it is a sacrifice all the same. 
They do have their vengeance, though, apparent in the bloody, unwashable
stains of guilt they leave on the feet of their killers.
