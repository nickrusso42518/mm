This clump of rotting food contains all sorts of elements.  There's part
of an ear of corn barely recognizable due to its brown color, a rancid bit
of pork that would gag any normal person on sight, and a moldy bread product
of some kind.  Beyond that, it's just gross, smelly mush that's slightly
organic to the tough.  It would be inadvisable to eat in its present form,
but maybe some of it could be salvaged.
