*A slice of luscious cake will last approximately 1,000 more Alyrian minutes.
Moist white cake flavored with almond and vanilla is frosted with a rich
buttercream scented with rose water.  A delicate pastel rose made of
marzipan and spun sugar tops the slice.  A layer of raspberry preserves is
placed between the layers of cake.  The baker takes great pride in creating
works of art for the couples of Alyria being joined on their special day.
