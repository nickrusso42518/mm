Without even looking, you can tell that this bread is common waybread 
by its texture and smell.  It is flat and round, and bears only a 
slight resemblance to common bread at all.  The crust is hard and dark, 
while the center is dense and soft.  However, it smells good and looks 
like it could fill you up when you get hungry.  Better eat it soon 
before it gets any harder and you break a tooth while eating it.
