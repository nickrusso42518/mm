A miniscule piece of bread sets here on the ground rotting.  It looks as
though it might have been a piece of rye or wheat but has become so hard and
discolored that it is hard to tell.  The crumb might satiate hunger for a
second or two but is no meal by any standards, unless of course your an ant.
