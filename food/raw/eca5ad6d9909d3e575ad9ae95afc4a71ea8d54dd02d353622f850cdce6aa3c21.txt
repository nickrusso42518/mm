Hay...  Does not taste good.  While it is, technically, edible, this
would not be anyone's first choice of a dietary requirement.  It is very
bland, with a hint of sour unpleasantness, and an aftertaste that causes
violent shudders.  The stems are long and tough, and rather difficult to
bite through.  However, eaten whole, they trigger a gag reflex, and in any
case, this does not make a pleasant meal.
