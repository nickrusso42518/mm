A large hunk of swiss cheese lies on the ground here.  It is covered with
dust, and as you brush off the dust you notice that a lot of what you
thought was dust is actually mold.  The chees smells rancid, but hey, when
you're hungry, you're hungry.  Well, you think to yourself.  You're not THAT
hungry.  At least, not yet!
