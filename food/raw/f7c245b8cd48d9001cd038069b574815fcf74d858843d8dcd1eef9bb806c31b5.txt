This green moss is known to be edible, although it is also known to taste
horrible, usually growing only in cool, damp dungeons.  You take an
experimental nibble from one corner and are immediately revolted by the
texture, smell and taste.  Still, food is food and it couldn't hurt to keep
it handy just in case.
