This unappetizing dish seems to be made from cat meat.  Although it is a
welcome change from the rat meat in the other dishes served at the local
restaurant, it still does not look very tasty.  Still, if you can't find
anything else to eat, you suppose that you will be able to get most of the
burger down.
